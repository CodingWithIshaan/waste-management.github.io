            <p>In the most recent years, food waste has become a complex phenomenon attracting the attention of
                scientists, consumers, and activists alike. <br>According to the UNEP Food Waste Index 2021 Report, The Food
                available for consumption worldwide is 5.3 billion tonnes and out of this 931 million tonnes gets wasted.<br> Lets

    <section class="Causes_Sec" id="Causes">
        <div class="CausesHeader">
            <h1>Causes</h1>
            <p>Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition (BFCN) defines food waste as the waste or food losses that occur during consumption,  distribution, and industrial processing. <br>Understanding and ending food waste has therefore been a priority among nonprofit organizations and governments which leads us to the discussion about major causes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ContainerBox">
            <div class="Box1 Public_Box">
                <h3>Lack of Planning</h3>
                <p>One of the top contributors to food wastage is lack of appropriate planning on the
                    consumer part. Sometimes people buy lots of food without appropriately making plans on when and how
                    the food will be prepared for consumption. <br><br>Coupled with the contemporary schedules of work
                    and appointments, people, therefore, tend to change food preparation plans or fail to remember using
                    it on time.
                    <br><br>At times its out of most peoples control which leads to the expiry of the foods after which
                    they are thrown as waste. Also due to lack of appropriate planning, people find themselves having
                    badly prepared food that just doesnt taste great. It all ends up as waste.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box2 Public_Box">
                <h3>Purchase and Over preparation</h3>
                <p>Most of the time, food is also wasted because of purchasing or preparing too much. If one purchases
                    or prepares too much food than is needed, then it’s obvious the excess food on the plate will go to
                    waste. <br><br>Restaurants, hotels, and foodservice industry have a tendency of
                    over-preparing food. In such scenarios, leftovers and partially used food account
                    for the food that goes to waste.<br><br>Alternatively, the partially used food, at times is put back in refrigerator and is never reused. The same applies to excess purchases that end up passing
                    their expiration dates and therefore looks, tastes, and smells bad. At the end of it all, all the
                    excess ends up as waste food.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box3 Public_Box">
                <h3>Errors in Industrial Processing</h3>
                <p>Another biggest driving factor for food wastage is the protocol on food safety. The food safety
                    protocols give no room for error in industrial processing that diminish the
                    quality of the final food products. <br><br>Production trials, packaging defects, trial runs, and wrong sizes and weights are some of the
                    aspects resulting in imperfection and the eventual rejection of the foods. <br><br>Food processing companies in complying with the food safety
                    policies, the companies in the sector end up creating waste as any small error means the food will
                    be rejected even if it’s simply due to imperfection in taste, appearance or shape.</p>

            <h1>Impact</h1>
            <p>Food production is one of the most resource intensive industries and causes high emissions of harmful
                substances. By generating food waste, all sources used in the production, transport or distributions of
                food are degraded. Wasting food also wastes water, energy, soil and money,
                which implies their environmental impactThe specific consequences of food waste
                are described in the FAO's Food wastage footprint: Impacts on natural resources.
                Most often we categorize them for environmental, economic and socialimpacts.</p>

        <div class="ContainerBox">
            <div class="Box1 Public_Box">
                <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
                <p>Meeting the food demand of a growing population and reducing food loss and waste poses a significant challenge. <br><br>Wasting a ton of wheat and rice would mean wasting 1,500 and 3,500 liters of water that goes into their production. <br><br>Within the food price chain, twenty-four percent of worldwide food loss and waste happens at the production stage, twenty-four percent throughout handling and storage, and thirty-five percent at consumption. According to FAO, once a year around 17 billion tons, or one-third of food made for human consumption, are lost or wasted globally.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box2 Public_Box">
                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <p>Food loss and waste generate approximately eight percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. <br><br>Food wastage has irreversible environmental effects and that emissions related to waste material may increase further.  <br><br>Because food waste management is one of the major source of global greenhouse gas emissions along with the wasted food we waste the water and energy it took to create it and produces ozone harming greenhouse gases — 7% of the world’s emissions— like methane, carbon dioxide, and chlorofluorocarbons, which contribute to Global warming.

                <h3>Social Impact</h3>
                <p>Although enough food is produced in the world, nearly a billion people worldwide suffer from hunger and malnutrition.<br><br> Many developed countries throw away tons of food that could be consumed in developing countries. <br><br>These foods are thrown away even though they are still good quality and safe. Similar problems also occur within individual developed countries. Part of the population has sufficient access to food, up to their surplus, but on the other hand there are socially weaker groups of the population who do not have the opportunity to buy quality food at all.</p>

            <p>For an efficient way of food waste management, business owners involved in the food production and
                manufacturing sector, there are various viable solutions prepared at hand. Here are a number of the
                foremost common and handiest ways to scale back or manage waste matter levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ContainerBox">
            <div class="Box1Prevention Public_Box">
                <h3>Recycle by Composting</h3>
                <p>Food producers will solve 100% of their waste matter issues by merely organizing a good composting
                    strategy. And doing therefore not solely eliminates waste, it saves you cash as a result of you
                    don’t have to be compelled to “outsource” your compost production. <br><br>Food waste has unique properties as a raw compost agent. <br><br>Because it has a high moisture content and low physical structure, it is important to mix fresh food waste with a bulking agent that will absorb some of the excess moisture as well as add structure to the mix.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box2Prevention Public_Box">
                <h3>Turning into Animal Feed</h3>
                <p>Cultivating compost is a method to recycle food, however it also can be drained of the bellies of
                    cows, sheep, pigs, and alternative ethereal (themselves destined to become food). <br><br>Farmers have been doing this for centuries. <br><br>With proper and safe handling, anyone can donate food scraps to animals. Food scraps for animals can save farmers and companies money. <br><br>It is often cheaper to feed animals food scraps rather than having them hauled to a landfill.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box3Prevention Public_Box">
                <h3>Source Reduction</h3>
                <p>The easiest method to curtail waste matter is to easily turn out less whenever production is clearly
                    resulting in waste. <br><br>Once excess foodstuffs are still safe to eat, there will be hungry and poor
                    people who realize it troublesome to afford decent food in today’s dear economy. Another biggest driving factor for food wastage is the protocol on food safety. <br><br>The food safety protocols give no room for error in industrial processing that diminish the quality of the final food products.</p>

            <p>Every one of us, at some time in our life, feels like contributing towards the betterment of the society.
                But among the various obstacles faced by many of us in doing so, are limitations pertaining to time. In
                order to tackle these and give you the opportunity to support our cause of food wastage.<br><br>

                Then come join our crusade and embark on a rewarding and satisfying journey.<br>

                <br>We believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the
                process of development, sustainable change will not happen. We encourage and invite individuals for
                volunteer opportunities and volunteer registration, to be an active part of our organization and share
                the same vision and purpose as us – to work for the welfare of children and their families. Volunteers
                are the backbone of every organization – they not only carry the organization’s ideals within them, but
                also spread the message far and beyond, sensitizing the society towards the cause. Volunteer for NGO,
                volunteer to serve, spread some smiles!<br><br>

                “Real Work, Real Change” is our ethos. Working on the ground to bring sustainable change is
                not easy, but in our country where more than half of the population is deprived even of its basic needs,
                this is where we must start. Before we debate on human rights, we must address urgent human needs. And
                this is what we has been tirelessly striving to achieve. Through intensive programmes
                based on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, we work towards bringing positive and
                long lasting change in the lives of children and their families. <br><br>

                People – committed, passionate individuals have always been at the core of all we do. Currently, we have
                a team of over 400 full-time professionals from diverse backgrounds working across India at our projects
                and offices. <br><br>
