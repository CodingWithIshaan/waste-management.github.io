                <h3>Lack of Planning</h3>
                <p>One of the top contributors to food wastage is because of a lack of appropriate planning on the
                    consumer part. Sometimes people buy lots of food without appropriately making plans on when and how
                    the food will be prepared for consumption. <br><br>Coupled with the contemporary schedules of work
                    and appointments, people, therefore, tend to change food preparation plans or fail to remember using
                    it on time.
                    <br><br>At times its out of most peoples control which leads to the expiry of the foods after which
                    they are thrown as waste. Also due to lack of appropriate planning, people find themselves having
                    badly prepared food that just doesnt taste great. It all ends up as waste.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box2 Public_Box">
                <h3>Purchase and Over preparation</h3>
                <p>Most of the time, food is also wasted because of purchasing or preparing too much. If one purchases
                    or prepares too much food than is needed, then it’s obvious the excess food on the plate will go to
                    waste. Most restaurants, hotels, and the foodservice industry alike have a tendency of
                    over-preparing/producing food.<br><br>In such scenarios, leftovers and partially used food account
                    for the food that goes to waste.<br><br>Alternatively, the partially used food is at times put at
                    the back of the fridge and is never reused. The same applies to excess purchases that end up passing
                    their expiration dates and therefore looks, tastes, and smells bad. At the end of it all, all the
                    excess ends up as waste food.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Box3 Public_Box">
                <h3>Errors in Industrial Processing</h3>
                <p>Another biggest driving factor for food wastage is the protocol on food safety. The food safety
                    protocols give no room for error in industrial processing or any other compromise that diminish the
                    quality of the final food products. <br><br>Food processing companies have to comply with high food
                    safety regulations and must thus establish no error margins. In complying with the food safety
                    policies, the companies in the sector end up creating waste as any small error means the food will
                    be rejected even if it’s simply due to imperfection in appearance or shape. <br><br>Overcooking,
                    production trials, packaging defects, trial runs, and wrong sizes and weights are some of the
                    aspects resulting in imperfection and the eventual rejection of the foods.</p>

            <h1>Impact</h1>
            <p>Food production is one of the most resource intensive industries and causes high emissions of harmful
                substances. By generating food waste, all sources used in the production, transport or distributions of
                food are degraded. Wasting food also wastes water, energy, soil and money,
                which implies their environmental impactThe specific consequences of food waste
                are described in the FAO's Food wastage footprint: Impacts on natural resources.
                Most often we categorize them for environmental, economic and socialimpacts.</p>

        <div class="ContainerBox">

                <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
                <p>The better process will feed 11 percent of the world’s population, several Indians. Meeting the food
                    desires of a growing population in India (1.7 billion by 2050) whereas reducing food loss and waste
                    poses a significant challenge. Wasting a ton of wheat and rice would mean wasting 1,500 and 3,500
                    liters of water severally that goes into their production.

                    Globally, virtually 250 cubic km of water and one.4 billion hectares of land are dedicated to
                    manufacturing food that’s lost or wasted. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
                    once a year around 17 billion tons, or one-third of food made for human consumption, are lost or
                    wasted globally. The associated economic, environmental, and social prices of this loss at around $1
                    trillion, $700 billion, and $900 billion p.a. severally.

                    In India, the worth of food wastage (harvest and post-harvest losses of major agricultural produce)
                    is calculable at around INR 92,000 crore once a year at 2014 wholesale costs. Within the food price
                    chain, twenty-four percent of worldwide food loss and waste happens at the production stage,
                    twenty-four percent throughout handling and storage, and thirty-five percent at consumption.

                    These 3 stages taken along account for over eighty percent of worldwide food loss and waste.
                    Quantifying waste material on the worth chain by investing in the recently discharged international
                    organization International Food Loss and Waste Protocol as a framework will facilitate India.</p>

            <div class="Box2 Public_Box">
                <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                <p>Food loss and waste are within the food and agriculture sector wherever diversifications to
                    temperature change are necessary. Food loss and waste generate approximately eight percent of
                    worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study predicts that emissions related to waste material
                    may increase further. Hence, the message for World Food Day, discovered on Gregorian calendar month
                    sixteen, was that “Climate is dynamical. Food and agriculture should too”.

                    While food waste management in India is gaining momentum, it needs to get a move on to help tackle
                    one of the globe’s most important issues that is climate change. Food wastage has irreversible
                    environmental effects. Because food waste management is ne of the major source of global greenhouse
                    gas emissions Along with the wasted food we waste the water and energy it took to create it and
                    produces ozone harming greenhouse gases — 7% of the world’s emissions— like methane, carbon dioxide,
                    and chlorofluorocarbons, which contribute to Global warming. Food that rots in landfills produces
                    nitrogen, which destroys soil nutrients and converts the lands into dead zones. Methane emitted from
                    the decomposition of food waste hangs around the atmosphere for 20 years and traps most of the heat
                    in the environment. This results in Climate Change.</p>

                <h3>Social Impact</h3>
                <p>Although enough food is produced in the world, nearly a billion people
                    worldwide suffer from hunger and malnutrition.Many developed countries throw
                    away tons of food that could be consumed in developing countries.. These foods
                    are thrown away even though they are still good quality and safe. Similar
                    problems also occur within individual developed countries.Part of the population
                    has sufficient access to food, up to their surplus, but on the other hand there are
                    socially weaker groups of the population who do not have the opportunity to buy
                    quality food, or sometimes they do not have enough food at all. At European level,
                    according to the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture, up to 50% of
                    edible and harmless food is unnecessarily depreciated and thrown away in
                    European homes, supermarkets, restaurants and along the entire food chain every
                    year.While 79 million citizens live below the poverty line and 16 million depend
                    on food aid provided by charities [3]. It is proven that feelings of life fulfillment
                    and satisfaction are not the result of the quantity of commodities owned and
                    consumption of goods, but the result of quality social relationships and
                    interactions, satisfying work and enough free time.</p>

                <h3>Recycle by Composting</h3>
                <p>Food producers will solve 100% of their waste matter issues by merely organizing a good composting
                    strategy. And doing therefore not solely eliminates waste, it saves you cash as a result of you
                    don’t have to be compelled to “outsource” your compost production.</p>

                <h3>Turning into Animal Feed</h3>
                <p>Cultivating compost is a method to recycle food, however it also can be drained of the bellies of
                    cows, sheep, pigs, and alternative ethereal (themselves destined to become food).</p>

                <h3>Source Reduction</h3>
                <p>The easiest method to curtail waste matter is to easily turn out less whenever production is clearly
                    resulting in waste. Once excess foodstuffs are still safe to eat, there will be hungry and poor
                    people who realize it troublesome to afford decent food in today’s dear economy.</p>
