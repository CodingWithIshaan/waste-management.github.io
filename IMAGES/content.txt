Food waste management in India is becoming a critical problem due to the continuous increase of the Indian population. Indians waste the maximum amount of food as much as the whole of the UK consumes – a data point which will not be most indicative of our love of surfeit, because it is of our population. Most of the food is wasted in weddings, canteens, hotels, social and family functions, and households. Still, food wastage is a horrendous issue, so is food waste management in India. Our streets, garbage bins, and landfills are spoiling our environment and have sufficient evidence to prove it.

Food processing companies have to comply with high food safety regulations and must thus establish no error margins. In complying with the food safety policies, the companies in the sector end up creating waste as any small error means the food will be rejected even if it’s simply due to imperfection in appearance or shape.
